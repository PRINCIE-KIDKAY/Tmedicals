                <p>Vital signs are essential physiological measurements reflecting key bodily functions: blood pressure, heart rate (pulse), respiratory rate, and body temperature. They offer crucial insights into overall health, cardiovascular function, respiratory efficiency, and metabolic activity. Monitoring these indicators helps assess health status, diagnose conditions, and guide treatment promptly.</p>

                <h3 class="mb-2">Hearing Test</h3>
                <p>A hearing test evaluates an individual's auditory function by measuring their ability to hear sounds at various frequencies and volumes. This typically involves listening to tones through headphones or responding to spoken words. The test helps identify hearing loss, assesses the degree and type of impairment, and guides recommendations for treatment or intervention.</p>

                <p>A doctor's exam involves a thorough assessment of a patient's physical health and well-being. It includes checking vital signs, discussing medical history, and conducting a physical examination to identify any signs of illness or abnormalities.

                <h3 class="mb-2">X-Ray</h3>
                <p>X-ray imaging is a diagnostic technique that uses electromagnetic radiation to create images of the inside of the body. It can reveal bone fractures, joint dislocations, and abnormalities in organs such as the lungs or heart. During the procedure, the patient is positioned between the X-ray machine and a film or digital detector, and a small dose of radiation is passed through the body. Dense structures like bones absorb more radiation, appearing white on the resulting image, while less dense tissues appear darker. X-rays are valuable for diagnosing a variety of medical conditions quickly and non-invasively.</p>
